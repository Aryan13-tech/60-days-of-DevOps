# 🐧 Linux Learning - Day 2

---

## 📅 Date
**November 6, 2025**

---

## 📘 1. Introduction
This README documents my **Day 2 progress** in learning Linux commands using **LabEx**.  
The focus of the day was on **file manipulation**, **directory management**, **content viewing**, and **file comparison** commands — essential skills for any system administrator or DevOps engineer.  

---

## ⚙️ 2. Learning Objectives
The goal for today’s session was to:
- Master copying and renaming files/directories.
- Learn how to delete files/directories safely.
- Explore commands for viewing and comparing file contents.
- Understand Linux’s **case-sensitive file system**.

---

## 📂 3. Tasks and Commands Practiced

### 🗂️ A. Copying Files and Directories
Learned how to use the `cp` command to duplicate files and folders.

```bash
cp ~/.zshrc ~/Desktop/zshrc-copy
cp -r ~/Code ~/Desktop/

Explanation:

cp → copies files.

-r → recursively copies all files and subdirectories.

ls -l ~/Desktop

✏️ B. Renaming Files and Directories

Practiced renaming using the mv command.

mv ~/Desktop/zshrc-copy ~/Desktop/zshrc-move
mv ~/Desktop/Code ~/Desktop/Code-move


Explanation:

mv → used to move or rename files and directories.

When used within the same path, it renames instead of moves.

🗑️ C. Removing Files and Directories

Used the rm command to delete files and directories permanently.

rm ~/Desktop/zshrc-move
rm -r ~/Desktop/Code-move


Explanation:

rm → removes files permanently.

-r → required for deleting directories and their contents.

📄 D. Viewing File Contents

Explored multiple commands to read file contents efficiently.

cat /tmp/hello
cat -n /tmp/hello
head -n1 /tmp/hello
head -c1 /tmp/hello
tail -n1 /tmp/hello
tail -c2 /tmp/hello


Example Output:

Hi,
I am Labby!


Explanation:

cat → view the entire file.

head → show top lines or characters.

tail → show bottom lines or characters.

-n → number of lines.

-c → number of characters.

⚖️ E. Comparing Files and Directories

Learned to compare file and directory contents using diff.

diff file1 file2


Example Output:

1c1
< this is file1
---
> this is file2


To compare directories recursively:

diff -r ~/Desktop ~/Code


Explanation:

diff → compares line-by-line differences.

-r → recursively compares directories.

Linux treats Code and code as different directories (case-sensitive).

🧠 4. Key Takeaways

Linux file and directory names are case-sensitive.

cp, mv, and rm are the fundamental commands for managing files.

Use head and tail for reading specific portions of files.

Use diff to compare files or directories efficiently.

Be cautious with rm — it permanently deletes files.

🚀 5. Next Goals

For the next session (Day 3), I will learn about:

File permissions using chmod

File ownership using chown

Viewing permissions using ls -l
